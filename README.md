# Bamazon CLI App
### A CLI app by Ryan Harris

## Explanation
---
Bamazon is a basic Amazon clone run in the Terminal. It allows the user to select from 10 different items and then choose how many of that item they would like to "purchase." After doing so, the app prints "Your order has been placed!" and asks the user if they would like to continue shopping. If they say Yes, the app displays updated stock levels for each item and the process repeats. However, if the user says No, then the app prints "Thank you! Have a good day!" and exits the program.

Screenshots demonstrating this are below.
